# RareEventABC

This package contains code for the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02492) "A rare event approach to high dimensional Approximate
Bayesian computation".
It's only intended to reproduce the paper's results and not to be a general purpose package.
See the "examples" directory for scripts used to perform all the analyses in the paper - these are sometimes a bit hacky unfortunately!
