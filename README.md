# RareEventABC

This package contains code for the paper "A rare event approach to high dimensional Approximate
Bayesian computation", shortly to be arXived.
It's only intended to reproduce the paper's results and not to be a general purpose package.
See the "examples" directory for scripts used to perform all the analyses in the paper - these are sometimes a bit hacky unfortunately!
